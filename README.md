# Compiler Course - Spring 2022

This repository contains materials and projects from the **Compiler** course, taken in Spring 2022 under the supervision of **Dr. Zali**. The course focused on the principles of compiler design and implementation, culminating in a project that encompassed three main phases.

## Project Overview

The project included the following phases:

1. **Lexical Analysis**:
   - Development of a lexical analyzer to tokenize the input source code.

2. **Syntax Analysis**:
   - Implementation of a syntax analyzer to parse the tokenized input and build a syntax tree.

3. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Conducting semantic checks to ensure that the parsed code adheres to the language's rules and constraints.

### Tools Used

- **Lex Tool**: Utilized for creating the lexical analyzer and handling tokenization of the source code.

## Course Objectives

The course aimed to provide students with a deep understanding of the architecture and functionality of compilers, as well as hands-on experience with tools used in compiler construction.

## Instructor

**Dr. Zali**
